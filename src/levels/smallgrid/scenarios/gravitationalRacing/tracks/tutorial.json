Earth's rotation is 1 second long</li><li>Masses are worked out based on their size but are scaled down from their real-life values by 0.000430823 (the Sun of radius 300m = real-life radius)</li><li>Distances between objects are scaled down by 10⁻⁸m</li><li>Fixed dynamic systems assume a perfectly circular path and do not affect the object at the center</li><li>Blackholes and neutron stars have the same mass of the sun but 3x and 2x the density respectively (this is because they are too extreme to be useable ever-wise)</li><li>All velocities are sped up by 2160000x ie. 1 real second = 25 days</li></ul></div>",
